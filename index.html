<p class="p">In the movies, when someone knocks on your door and is, like, “Housekeeping,” it’s almost always
    someone wanting to arrest and/or murder you. In real life, it is someone with a cart of clean
    towels who may want to arrest and/or murder you, but isn’t allowed to, because of the law.</p>
<p class="p">In the movies, kids always seem to know everything. In real life,
    children don’t know much at all, infact they sit hours learning
    web development to submit their assignments.</p>
<p class="p">In the movies, Prince Charming will sweep you off your feet.
    In real life, mostly that every man is unbearable</p>
<p class="p">In the movies, a high-school nerd can become popular overnight after a makeover montage.
    In real life, a high-school nerd can only become the billionaire C.E.O. of a major tech company</p>
<p class="p">In the movies, all your dreams come true. You win the big game, fall in love, get the perfect job,
    and are able to have it all. In real life, well, we hope. </p>
<b><P class="p"> The central problem here is:</P></b>

<p class="issue">
    GETTING HISTORY WRONG IN MOVIES AFFECTS HOW PEOPLE SEE REAL HISTORY,
    WHICH CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON HOW THEY SEE THE PRESENT.
    </p>
<P>A perfect explanation comes from director Christopher Nolan, who,
after discussing the “real world” setting of his Dark Knight trilogy, had this to say:</P>
<p>
    But it’s about what I suppose you might term a cinematic reality. It’s about giving the world of the films and the characters as much weight and validity as they would if your 
    source material were not a comic book — if he was a character in another genre of film you were having to introduce to the audience for the first time and get them to believe it. That’s really what my use of the word reality is about. It’s not about a literal reality.
    Part of the appeal of the world of Gotham is that it is not real life. It is removed from real life. So you can address dramatic elements that would be extremely uncomfortable in a realistic film — in a way that lets the audience enjoy the experience and entertainment. — USA Today

<p class="p">Part of the cinematic experience is being taken away to imaginative lands or seeing something exciting happen in a mundane setting. That is why so many films use a cinematic
    reality — a world that is grounded in actual reality but best serves the overall aesthetic of a film.
